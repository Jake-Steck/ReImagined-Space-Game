# ReImagined-Space-Game
This is a Re Imagined space game I made with some help from my coding instructor. 


This is just a little game me and my friend coded using pygame. We got help from our coding instructor. Comments are encouraged. I know pygame isn't really the number 1 language used for video games, but we still did it! This is here for me to look back at when I am older to see the advancements I have made. Feel free to use the code and edit the code and do what you want with it. **ANYTHING LEGAL** 

Thank you and have a great day!
